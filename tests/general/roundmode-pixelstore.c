/**
 * @file roundmode-pixelstore.c
 *
 * Tests that the floating point rounding mode doesn't impact
 * glPixelStore's rounding behavior.
 *
 * From the GL 2.1 specification, page 114 (page 128 of the PDF):
 *
 *     "The version of PixelStore that takes a floating-point value
 *      may be used to set any type of parameter; if the parameter is
 *      boolean, then it is set to FALSE if the passed value is 0.0
 *      and TRUE otherwise, while if the parameter is an integer, then
 *      the passed value is rounded to the nearest integer."
