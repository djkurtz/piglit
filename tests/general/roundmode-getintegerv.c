/**
 * @file roundmode-getintegerv.c
 *
 * Tests that the floating point rounding mode doesn't impact
 * glGetIntegerv's rounding behavior.
 *
 * From the GL 2.1 specification, page 248 (page 262 of the PDF):
 *
 *     "If a Get command is issued that returns value types different
 *      from the type of the value being obtained, a type conversion
 *      is performed...  If GetIntegerv (or any of the Get commands
 *      below) is called, a boolean value is interpreted as either 1
 *      or 0, and a floating-point value is rounded to the nearest
 *      integer, unless the value is an RGBA color component, a
 *      DepthRange value, a depth buffer clear value, or a normal
 *      coordinate."
