/**
 * \file front-buffer-distraction.c
 *
 * Test that a fast color clear of the back buffer is properly
 * resolved even if we try to "distract" the implementation by forcing
 * a fast color clear resolve in the front buffer.  This verifies that
 * either (a) fast color clears are independently tracked between the
 * front and back buffers, or (b) the implementation resolves fast
 * clears before switching from back buffer rendering to front buffer
 * rendering.
 *
 * The test operates by fast clearing the back buffer, then fast
 * clearing the front buffer, then reading from the front buffer
 * (forcing a front buffer resolve), then reading from the back buffer
 * (forcing a back buffer resolve).
