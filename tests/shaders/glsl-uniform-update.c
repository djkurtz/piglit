/** @file glsl-uniform-update.c
 *
 * Tests that updates to uniforms between drawing calls get respected.
 *
 * Create a simple shader that passes through vertex data, and uses a uniform
 * to set a color, and just updates that uniform between draw calls.  This
 * catches a bug found in the 965 driver in an app I was writing.
