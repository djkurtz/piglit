/**
 * \name ActiveShaderProgram-invalid-program.c
 * Verify glActiveShaderProgram with invalid program parameter
 *
 * There are several cases outlined in the GL 4.4 spec where
 * glActiveShaderProgram should generate specific errors.  In addition,
 * section 2.3.1 (Errors) says:
 *
 *     "Currently, when an error flag is set, results of GL operation are
 *     undefined only if an OUT_OF_MEMORY error has occurred. In other cases,
 *     there are no side effects unless otherwise noted; the command which
 *     generates the error is ignored so that it has no effect on GL state or
 *     framebuffer contents."
 *
 * After calling glActiveShaderProgram with an invalid parameter, verify that
 * the active program state has not been modified.
