 * From the GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object spec:
 *
 *     "For uniform blocks laid out according to [std140] rules, the
 *      minimum buffer object size returned by the
 *      UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE query is derived by taking the offset
 *      of the last basic machine unit consumed by the last uniform of
 *      the uniform block (including any end-of-array or
 *      end-of-structure padding), adding one, and rounding up to the
 *      next multiple of the base alignment required for a vec4."
