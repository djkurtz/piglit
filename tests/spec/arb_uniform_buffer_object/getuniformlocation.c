/** @file getuniformlocation.c
 *
 * Tests that glGetUniformLocation() returns no location for UBO variables.
 *
 * From the GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object spec:
 *
 *      To find the location within a program object of an active uniform
 *      variable associated with the default uniform block, use the command
 *
 *          int GetUniformLocation(uint program, const char *name);
 *
 *      ... The value -1 will be returned if <name> does not
 *      correspond to an active uniform variable name in <program>, if
 *      <name> is associated with a named uniform block..."
