 *
 *     "To query the starting offset or size of the range of each
 *      buffer object binding used for uniform buffers, call
 *      GetIntegeri_v with <param> set to UNIFORM_BUFFER_START or
 *      UNIFORM_BUFFER_SIZE respectively. <index> must be in the range
 *      zero to the value of MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS - 1. If the
 *      parameter (starting offset or size) was not specified when the
 *      buffer object was bound, zero is returned. If no buffer object
 *      is bound to <index>, -1 is returned."
