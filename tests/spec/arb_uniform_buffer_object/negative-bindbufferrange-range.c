/** @file negative-bindbufferrange-range.c
 *
 * From the GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object spec:
 *
 *     "For BindBufferRange, <offset> specifies a starting offset into
 *      the buffer object <buffer>, and <size> specifies the amount of
 *      data that can be read from the buffer object while used as the
 *      storage for a uniform block. Both <offset> and <size> are in
 *      basic machine units. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if
 *      the value of <size> is less than or equal to zero, if <offset>
 *      + <size> is greater than the value of BUFFER_SIZE, or if
 *      <offset> is not a multiple of the implementation-dependent
 *      required alignment
 *      (UNIFORM_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT). BindBufferBase is
 *      equivalent to calling BindBufferRange with <offset> zero and
 *      <size> equal to the size of <buffer>."
