/** @file negative-getactiveuniformsiv.c
 *
 * From the GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object spec:
 *
 *     "If any index is greater than or equal to the value of
 *      ACTIVE_UNIFORMS, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.
 *
 *      For GetActiveUniformsiv, <uniformCount> indicates both the
 *      number of elements in the array of indices <uniformIndices>
 *      and the number of parameters written to <params> upon
 *      successful return.  <pname> identifies a property of each
 *      uniform in <uniformIndices> that should be written into the
 *      corresponding element of <params>.  If an error occurs,
 *      nothing will be written to <params>.
 *
 *      The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by GetUniformIndices,
 *      GetActiveUniformsiv, GetActiveUniformName,
 *      GetUniformBlockIndex, GetActiveUniformBlockiv,
 *      GetActiveUniformBlockName, and UniformBlockBinding if
 *      <program> is not a value generated by GL.
 *
 *      The error INVALID_ENUM is generated by GetActiveUniformsiv and
 *      GetActiveUniformBlockiv if <pname> is not one of the accepted
 *      values."
