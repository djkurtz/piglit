/** \file
 *
 * Test that exceeding the implementation's size work group size
 * limits results in a compile error.
 *
 * From the ARB_compute_shader specification:
 *
 *     If the local size of the shader in any dimension is greater
 *     than the maximum size supported by the implementation for that
 *     dimension, a compile-time error results.
 *
 * It is not clear from the spec how the error should be reported if
 * the total size of the work group exceeds
 * MAX_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_INVOCATIONS, but it seems reasonable to
 * assume that this is reported at compile time as well.
