/**

 *
 * From the EXT_framebuffer_multisample spec:
 *
 *     "Finally, the behavior of several GL operations is specified
 *      "as if the arguments were passed to CopyPixels."  These
 *      operations include: CopyTex{Sub}Image*, CopyColor{Sub}Table,
 *      and CopyConvolutionFilter*.  INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION_EXT
 *      will be generated if an attempt is made to execute one of
 *      these operations, or CopyPixels, while the object bound to
 *      READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT (section 4.4) is not "framebuffer
 *      complete" (as defined in section 4.4.4.2).  INVALID_OPERATION
 *      will be generated if the object bound to
 *      READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT is "framebuffer complete" and the
 *      value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is greater than zero."
 *
 * The Errors section says that these and ReadPixels report
 * "INVALID_OPERATION_EXT", but that appears to be a typo.
