/**

 *
 * From the EXT_framebuffer_multisample spec:
 *
 *     "The values of SAMPLE_BUFFERS and SAMPLES are derived from the
 *      attachments of the currently bound framebuffer object.  If the
 *      current DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT is not "framebuffer
 *      complete", then both SAMPLE_BUFFERS and SAMPLES are undefined.
 *      Otherwise, SAMPLES is equal to the value of
 *      RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES_EXT for the attached images (which all
 *      must have the same value for RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES_EXT).
 *      Further, SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one if SAMPLES is non-zero.
 *      Otherwise, SAMPLE_BUFFERS is zero."
