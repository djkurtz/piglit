/**
 * @file renderbuffer-samples.c
 *
 * Tests that asking for samples gives the correct number of
 * GL_RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES.
 *
 * From the EXT_framebuffer_multisample spec:
 *
 *     "If <samples> is zero, then RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES_EXT is set to
 *      zero.  Otherwise <samples> represents a request for a desired
 *      minimum number of samples. Since different implementations may
 *      support different sample counts for multisampled rendering,
 *      the actual number of samples allocated for the renderbuffer
 *      image is implementation dependent.  However, the resulting
 *      value for RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES_EXT is guaranteed to be greater
 *      than or equal to <samples> and no more than the next larger
 *      sample count supported by the implementation.
 *
 * Note also this issue:
 *
 * "    (2)  What happens when <samples> is zero or one?
 *
 *           RESOLVED, 0 = single sample, 1 = minimum multisample
 *
 *           Resolved by consensus, May 9, 2005
 *
 *           Zero means single sample, as if RenderbufferStorageEXT
 *           had been called instead of
 *           RenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT.  One means minimum
 *           number of samples supported by implementation.
 *
 *           There was a question if one should mean the same thing as
 *           single-sample (one sample), or if it should mean the
 *           minimum supported number of samples for multisample
 *           rendering.  The rules for rasterizing in "multisample"
 *           mode are different than "non-multisample" mode.  In the
 *           end, we decided that some implementations may wish to
 *           support a "one-sample" multisample buffer to allow for
 *           multipass multisampling where the sample location can be
 *           varied either by the implementation or perhaps explicitly
 *           by a "multisample location" extension."
