 *     "ALREADY_SIGNALED will always be returned if <sync> was
 *      signaled, even if the value of <timeout> is zero
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      If the value of <timeout> is zero, then ClientWaitSync does
 *      not block, but simply tests the current state of
 *      <sync>. TIMEOUT_EXPIRED will be returned in this case if
 *      <sync> is not signaled, even though no actual wait was
 *      performed."
