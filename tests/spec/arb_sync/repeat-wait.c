/** @file repeat-wait.c
 *
 * From the GL_ARB_sync spec:
 *
 *     "If <sync> is signaled at the time ClientWaitSync is called
 *      then ClientWaitSync returns immediately. If <sync> is
 *      unsignaled at the time ClientWaitSync is called then
 *      ClientWaitSync will block and will wait up to <timeout>
 *      nanoseconds for <sync> to become signaled.
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      ALREADY_SIGNALED will always be returned if <sync> was
 *      signaled, even if the value of <timeout> is zero."
 *
 * There was concern that the implementation of the kernel API on i965
 * might violate this for the specific case of back-to-back
 * ClientWaitSyncs, but Mesa core doesn't end up calling into the
 * driver on a later ClientWaitSync.
