/**
 * \file active-sampler-conflict.c
 * Verify results of program validation when a conflicting sampler
 * configuration is used.
 *
 * Section 2.15.4 (Shader Execution), subheading "Validation" of the OpenGL
 * 2.0 spec says:
 *
 *     "[INVALID_OPERATION] is generated by Begin, RasterPos, or any
 *     command that performs an implicit Begin if:
 *
 *         - any two active samplers in the current program object are
 *           of different types, but refer to the same texture image
 *           unit,"
 *
 * This test verifies this behavior several ways.  First, an invalid
 * configuration is constructed.  When the program is in the invalid
 * configuration, glValidateProgram is used to determine the status.
 *
 * The program is then transitioned to a valid configuration, and
 * glValidateProgram is called again.
 *
 * The program is then transitioned back to the invalid configuration.
 * Without calling glValidateProgram, glBegin is called.  This should generate
 * the aforementioned error.  While still in the invalid state
 * glValidateProgram is called a third time.
 *
 * Finally, the program is transitioned back to the valid configuration.
 * Without calling glValidateProgram, glBegin is called.  This should not
 * generate any error.
 *
 * All of the state flip-flopping is done in an attempt to catch
 * implementations that latch state in glValidateProgram and do not
 * re-validate in glBegin.
