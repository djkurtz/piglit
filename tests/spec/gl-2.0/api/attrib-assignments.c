/**

 * Verify that vertex shader attributes are assigned in order starting with 0.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT REQUIRED BY ANY VERSION OF THE OpenGL SPECIFICATION!
 *
 * However, almost every OpenGL implementation happens to behave this way when
 * there is a single vertex shader compilation unit linked into the program.
 * As a result, some programs accidentally rely on this behavior.  If the
 * application was never tested on a implementation that behaves any other
 * way, there's a reasonable chance it has bugs without its developers even
