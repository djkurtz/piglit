/**
 * Test that built-in vertex input variables are enumerated by GetActiveAttrib()
 *
 * This is not explicitly stated in any specs before 4.3 core but it seems to
 * be clarified in later specs
 *
 * From GL 4.3 core spec, section 11.1.1 (Vertex Attributes):
 * "For GetActiveAttrib, all active vertex shader input variables are
 *  enumerated, including the special built-in inputs gl_VertexID and
 *  gl_InstanceID."
 *
 * From GL 4.3 core spec, section F.5 (Change Log for Released Specifications):
 * "Specify in section 11.1.1 that special built-in inputs and outputs such as
 *  gl_VertexID should be enumerated in the PROGRAM_INPUT and PROGRAM_OUTPUT
 *  interfaces, as well as the legacy function GetActiveAttrib. Add spec
 *  language counting the built-ins gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID against the
 *  active attribute limit (Bug 9201)."
