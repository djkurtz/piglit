/** @file fbo-front-invalidate-back.c
 *
 * This test validates a corner case in the Intel mesa driver: if GL
 * calls that require access to the front buffer are followed by GL
 * calls that don't require access to the front buffer, and an
 * invalidate event is received from the server in between, then
 * before the driver responds to the invalidate event by requesting a
 * new back buffer, it needs to flush the pending front buffer
 * rendering.  Otherwise the front buffer rendering will be lost.
 *
 * Unfortunately, we can't force the server to send an invalidate
 * event to the driver at a specific time; however, thanks to a quirk
 * in the driver, we can simulate one using a sequence of
 * glDrawBuffer() calls.
